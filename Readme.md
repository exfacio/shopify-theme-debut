# Ex Facio Shopify Theme

## ðŸš¨ Caution

As of right now modifying the theme via `npm run dev` will update the live site. We'll need to setup an actual dev store post launch.

## Getting Started with Shopify Themes

## Development

1. Get `config.yml` file that contains app secrets.
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run dev`

### Notes

- When editing scss files, always edit `*.scss.liquid`. The liquid files have access to theme settings from the Shopify store and will automatically be converted from liquid to scss, then from scss to css.
